                    <li>
                        <i><b>Arithmetically Inclined</b></i>
                        <br>
                        I am a lover of mathematics. I have been developing myself as well as well as others in this arena by tutoring CSEC math students as well as students at other levels.<br>
                        My aim is to continue to improve ad eventually impact a lot more lives in changing the perspective that math is hard.

                        <br>
                        

                    <li>
                        <i><b>Talented</b></i> 
                      <br>
                        I grew up in a very religious family. I was required to go to and particpate in church service. <br>
                        Therefore, I got the platform and several opportunities to discover what my talents are.<br>
                        <center><img src="../Assets/IAImages/Singing.jpg" width="200px" height="300px"></center> <br>
                        I have attempted singing as well as contempoarary dancing.
                        Needless to say that i have been successfu in both. Both talents have contributed to my development. Especially my ability to sing well. <br>
                        I find myself singing at a lot of events with a different audience everytime and this builds my confidence immensely.

                    </li>
                        <br>

                    <li>
                        <i><b>Good Leader</b></i> 
                        <br>
                        My resume clearly shows that I have assumed roles in leadership numerous times. This has afforded me ample time to be the best follow and leader as well.<br>
                        A lot of persons may look at me and assume that I am always bold  and outspoken. However, I am these things only when I neeed to be. I always have to give myself a pep talk as in my head this is me stepping far outside my comfort zone.<br>
                        There has definitely been personal development. Being in these leadership positions has allowed me to conquer my fears in the various arenas that I find myself.<br>
                        These positions prepared me for the tertiary level. I was able to apply what I have learnt to this level of my education.

            <center><h2 style="background-color: purple">Chapters 4-7 of "Twelve Pillars"</h2> </center>
            I have read the material in order to contribute my perspective as well as how it can be applied to my life.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Pillar 4: The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.</b></li>
                <br>
                This chapter encapsulates the thought of setting goals. This is where you decide where it is that you want to go and design some sort of plan that will take you ther. <br>
                these are goals that will require you dong things in a different manner in order to achieve the future that you want. I have listened to numerous empowerment coaches speak <br>
                on the importance of having a goal. Writing down what you want and manifesting it; all the while testing your limits and going out of your comfort zone to do so. I thas been my <br>
                dream to become a doctor. It is going to take me a little longer than I planned to do so but I plan on getting there anyway. i have strategically made a note of what i need to do to get where i need to be. <br>

                <li id="quote"><b>Pillar 5: Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.</b></li>
                <br>
                The book makes mention of two pains:discipline and regret. The author laments on and on about the fact that discipline significantly weighs less than regrets. This is definitely applicable<br>
                to my life as, in the medical field discipline is important. Especially when studying to acquire the degree. The book encourages me to spend time on what is important and be my own designer of my life. <br>
                Your best opportunity each day are those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on-in the words of the writer.<br>

                <li><b>Pillar 6:  Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.</b></li>
                <br>
                Pillar 6 illustrates the importance of having big dreams. Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high. <br>
                These things are affected by the persons that I am around and the effect that they have on my life. There is one profound point that i have to make mention of, Friends of convenience.  This is an interesting concept.  Is it easier to keep certain people for friends, instead of pursuing new friends. Successful people look for relationships with other successful people who will push them, challenge them, and encourage them to become better. To attract attractive people, you must be attractive.  Not physically but mentally and who you are. <br> 
                I completely agree that my attitude is greatly influenced by the people that I surround myself with. Over the years I have proven this statement and I have made it mhy point of duty to especially remove persons from my life that are not making meaningful contributions.<br>

                <li><b>Pillar 7: Formal education will make you a living.  Self education will make you a fortune.</b></li>
                Lastly, Friends of convenience.  This is an interesting concept.  Is it easier to keep certain people for friends, instead of pursuing new friends. Successful people look for relationships with other successful people who will push them, challenge them, and encourage them to become better. To attract attractive people, you must be attractive.  Not physically but mentally and who you are. Self-education is what you teach yourself.  It is what you learn along the way so that you are constantly improving and growing. Most people don’t continue to learn and grow, to separate yourself from everyone else, be focused on continuous learning.

                Learning is the beginning of wealth.  Learning is the beginning of health.  Learning is the beginning of spirituality.  Searching and learning are where the miracle process all begins. Most of life is lived after your formal education. That means the rest of it is up to you.
                
                You have to read the books.  Books are and will continue to be the best learning tools of mankind.
                <br> Both points really resonate with me. I hav acknowledged the importance of formal education which resulted in me enrolling in an institution at the teritiary level. I plan to  receive all the formal education that I need in order to achieve my dream. As it relates to self education I definitely concur with the writer. I constantly try to keep y mind occupied by reading books and surfing the internet in order to garner more knowledge.
