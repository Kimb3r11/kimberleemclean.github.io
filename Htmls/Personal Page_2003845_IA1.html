               Who am I? <br>
               Well, embedded in what most describe as a cold exterior is a sweet teedy bear in my opinion. I have proven it for myself that I am very in touch with my emotions. Those I love will see and know that I love them through my actions. <br>
               The Merriam Webster Dictionary describes a trait as a quality that differentiates you from someomne else.

               To start, I would definitely say that my personality provides a clear distinction. I love to laugh, I love to make people laugh and that is something that someone cane identify from a mile away. At least that is what I am told. 
               <br>
               There is something else that makes me unique; my passion. <br>
               My passion when showing love family. <br>
               My passion when showing love to friends. <br>
               My passion towards my school work and I hope to achieve. <br>
               My passion towards everything.

                I like food. No, I love food. I think it is my love language. Bring me food and I'll love you forever. <br>
                I like spending time with those I love. Whether firends or family. This gives me genuine peace and happiness. <br>
                I like animals but only when they are in a juvenile stage. Thats the stage where they are the most adorable.
                I like to sleep too. As a university student that one is warranted.
                <br>             
                What don't I like you may ask? I dislike hearing people chew their food. I find it very disturbing.<br>
                An untidy environment is somethig else that really gets to me. Another thing is people invading my personal space.
                <br> 
                I am a little bit of an introvert and extrovert. Sometimes I prefer to stay in and read a god book, sleep or eat and watch movies.<br>
                Other days I'm in a hurry to go on adventures or just be anywhere other than in the house.<br>
                I love music and listening to it whie I do almost everything is great to pass the time in my opinion.

                I took the Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test. I believe that this test has validity in general but not necessarily my individual case.<br>
                I beleive that the algorithm was set up to give a result based on the answers that would be given but this cannot be applied to all indiviual cases as everyone is different. <br>
